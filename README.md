Project Structure
The project is organized into the following files, all located in the root directory for simplicity:

/
|-- index.html          # The main landing page (Home)
|-- about.html          # The page describing the developer
|-- Experience.html     # The page detailing professional experience
|-- projects.html       # The page showcasing projects
|-- contact.html        # The contact page with a form and details
|-- style.css           # The single stylesheet for the entire site
|-- script.js           # The single JavaScript file for all dynamic functionality

HTML Files: Each HTML file represents a different page of the portfolio. They are linked together through the navigation bar.

style.css: This file contains all the styling rules for the entire website. It uses CSS variables for easy theme customization and is organized into logical sections.

script.js: This file handles all the interactive elements of the site, including the typing animation, mobile menu, and contact form feedback.

Setup and Usage
To use this portfolio template:

Download the Files: Save all the files (.html, .css, .js) into a single folder on your computer.

Open in Browser: Open the index.html file in your web browser to view the website.

Navigate: Use the navigation links to move between the different pages.

Customization
To make this portfolio your own, you will need to edit the content in the HTML files:

Text Content: Open each .html file in a text editor and replace the placeholder text (like names, descriptions, and project details) with your own information.

Images:

Replace the profile picture in index.html and about.html by changing the src attribute in the <img> tags.

For project images in projects.html, update the src attribute for each .project-card.

Links: Update the href attributes in the <a> tags for your social media profiles (in the footer of each page) and for your project links (projects.html).

Styling (Optional): To change the color scheme, you can modify the CSS variables at the top of the style.css file. For example, to change the main accent color, simply update the value of --primary-color.
